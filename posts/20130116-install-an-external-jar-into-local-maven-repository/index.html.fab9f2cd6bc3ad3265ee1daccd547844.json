In this case, you have to put it to your local repository your self to solve the dependency.</p>\n<p>There is a install plug in to do this job, which is something like:\n<br>\n<br>\nmvn install:install-file -DgroupId=<br>\n-DartifactId=<br>\n-Dversion=<br>\n-Dfile=<br>\n-Dpackaging=jar\n-DgeneratePom=true</p>\n<p>For example, you want to install the danga’s memcached client plugin, you can do:\n<br>\n<br>\nmvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.danga\n-DartifactId=memcached\n-Dversion=2.0.1\n-Dfile=java_memcached-release_2.0.1.jar\n-Dpackaging=jar\n-DgeneratePom=true</p>\n<p>This will add the memcache jar into your local Maven2 repository under groupId com.danga and artifactId memcached, you can then edit your pom.xml adding this dependency.</p>\n<p>However, the maven eclipse can not recognize it since it always search from public repository.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comments\"><a href=\"#comments\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Comments</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#32\" title=\"2013-06-04 09:39:19\">traffic</a>:</strong> Thank you ever so for you post.Much thanks again.

There will be additional functionality as new APIs are incorporated into the release, but the focus will be on the look and feel of the user experience,” Baker said.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#34\" title=\"2013-08-08 22:05:47\">abercrombie</a>:</strong> Install an external jar into local Maven repository | Asanka's Blog... <a href=\"http://2013abercrombiekids.webs.com/http://2013abercrombiefitch.webs.com/\">abercrombie femme</a></p>\n","__filename":"posts/20130116-install-an-external-jar-into-local-maven-repository.md","__url":"/posts/20130116-install-an-external-jar-into-local-maven-repository/","__resourceUrl":"/posts/20130116-install-an-external-jar-into-local-maven-repository/index.html","__dataUrl":"/posts/20130116-install-an-external-jar-into-local-maven-repository/index.html.fab9f2cd6bc3ad3265ee1daccd547844.json"}
