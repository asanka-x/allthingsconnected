And it's a waste if your PC has only few USB ports. So anyways there is a cool solution for this. If both your PC and your android device are connected to a wireless network (should be in same network), you can debug your device wireless. <strong>Step 1</strong> Connect your device to your PC via a USB connection (Make sure USB debugging is on) <strong>Step 2</strong> Go to your android platform-tools directory and open a command window and run\n<br>\n<br>\nadb tcpip 5555\n               adb connect <Device IP>:5555</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Disconnect USB connection. Now you can debug your device wireless, you can run \"adb logcat\" and check whether it's working. To switch back to USB run the following command\n<br>\n<br>\nadb usb</p>\n","__filename":"posts/20131115-android-debugging-over-lanwifi.md","__url":"/posts/20131115-android-debugging-over-lanwifi/","__resourceUrl":"/posts/20131115-android-debugging-over-lanwifi/index.html","__dataUrl":"/posts/20131115-android-debugging-over-lanwifi/index.html.6485ab2f7aee15216adcf9947044fcd2.json"}
