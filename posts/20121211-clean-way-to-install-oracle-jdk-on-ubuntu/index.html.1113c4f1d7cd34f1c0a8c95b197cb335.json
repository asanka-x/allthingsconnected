But as my personal choice I would prefer Oracle JDK the most.  </p>\n<p>Basically there are two main ways to install JDK on ubuntu<br>\nDownload JDK linux package and install it<br>\nAdd the repository containing oracle JDK packages and install using \"apt-get\"  </p>\n<p>I'll be focusing on the second method since it's a more clean way to install, that it will install the packages to the most suitable locations. Obviously we can install it to our preferred location following the first method but if we are configuring a production server it is recommended to follow the standard locations to which the JAVA like environments should be installing.  </p>\n<p>This is all you have to do (See this is simpler than the first method)  </p>\n<p>    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java<br>\nsudo apt-get update<br>\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer</p>\n","__filename":"posts/20121211-clean-way-to-install-oracle-jdk-on-ubuntu.md","__url":"/posts/20121211-clean-way-to-install-oracle-jdk-on-ubuntu/","__resourceUrl":"/posts/20121211-clean-way-to-install-oracle-jdk-on-ubuntu/index.html","__dataUrl":"/posts/20121211-clean-way-to-install-oracle-jdk-on-ubuntu/index.html.1113c4f1d7cd34f1c0a8c95b197cb335.json"}
