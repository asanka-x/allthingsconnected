The authors acknowledge that continuous deployment into production is not always a good idea. They also imply that Continuous Deployment might mean only that your application is always ready and easy to deploy into production, not that you necessarily deploy it constantly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your implementation should make it possible to deploy any version of your application that has made it past the automated tests into any of your environments at the push of a button, given the correct credentials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Compliance and security are also factors that may rightly make it impossible to automate deployment to production completely.</p>\n<p>Client-installed applications present some special difficulties which Humble and Farley discuss.</p>\n<p>In summary then:</p>\n<p><strong>Continuous integration</strong>: your application always builds and passes its tests, including all the pieces from different sub-teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Continuous delivery</strong>: your application always builds and deploys to a test environment and passes its tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Continuous deployment</strong>: your application is always ready to deploy to production through a largely automated process.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: I received an email from Martin Fowler about this post. He refers to Jez Humble’s post on <a href=\"http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/\">Continuous Delivery vs Continous Deployment</a> and adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>- I would use your definition of Continuous Deployment for Continuous Delivery</p>\n<p>- I would change the definition of Continuous Deployment to say something like \"every good build is released to production\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"comments\"><a href=\"#comments\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Comments</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#28\" title=\"2013-07-24 22:35:18\">http://camdentonteaparty.org</a>:</strong> The following blog post, “CI vs CD vs CD | Asanka's Blog...” indicates the fact that u comprehend what precisely you are communicating about!
