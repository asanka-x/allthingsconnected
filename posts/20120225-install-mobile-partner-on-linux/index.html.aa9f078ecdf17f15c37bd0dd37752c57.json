But we can't send/receive SMSs or use data counter (Statistics) since the modem is detected and configured by network manager, so we don't get a GUI for mobile partner.  </p>\n<p>If you want get the GUI you can download the driver from link bellow.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/?j3a63cq1p4847tp\">Download GUI Mobile Partner driver</a>  </p>\n<p>It's work for CDMA and GSM modems. After downloading the driver, follow this instruction to install it  </p>\n<p>1.) Extract the downloaded file</p>\n<p>                    Use your preferred tool to extract the zip file</p>\n<p>2.) Open a terminal and type</p>\n<p>                    cd /Linux # Goto extracted directory &#x26; open Linux folder</p>\n<p>                    sudo chmod -R 777 install # Give execute permission</p>\n<p>                    sudo ./install # Run \"install\" shell script</p>\n<p>3.) Press enter when you get noticed please input the absolute path for install, the installation file will be placed on default path</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://asankanissanka.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/installmobilepartner1.png?w=300\"></p>\n<p>Wait untill installation progress is finished. After that, when you plug the modem, the GUI for mobile partner will be automatically open. And now you can use the GUI for short messaging and data counting.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://asankanissanka.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/installmobilepartner31.png?w=300\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"comments\"><a href=\"#comments\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Comments</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#1\" title=\"2012-03-08 03:22:09\">bckurera</a>:</strong> yeah this(Safaricom) works for Fedora as well. But I nt supported for my Fedora 15, 64bit !!But doing well with 32bits.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#2\" title=\"2012-03-08 03:47:33\">Asanka Nissanka</a>:</strong> I couldn't try this on a 64-bit version. So thanks for mentioning that. Anyways some of the dongles (Like Dialog dongles) come along with the linux mobile partner.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#3\" title=\"2012-09-02 14:46:46\">mpe</a>:</strong> thanks mate.... it's working</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#4\" title=\"2012-09-02 17:20:50\">Asanka Nissanka</a>:</strong> You are welcome bro !!!! And thank you for the feedback :)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#6\" title=\"2012-11-11 14:53:55\">pushpikede</a>:</strong> This does not work in my system. Installing this software made xubuntu unable to detect my Huawei e156g which was working flawlessly ever before. It was very difficullt to remove the software and even after removing it, my system failed to detect the dongle. I had to underwent a really hard time to get it back to work.<br>\nBeware that this is not a normal Ubuntu software and installing it will change a few of your system files which would be very difficult to reset. Before installing this check whether your dongle is supported.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#7\" title=\"2012-12-02 17:52:21\">Anonymous</a>:</strong> can u upload drivers for 64-bit also?</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#8\" title=\"2012-12-02 18:17:22\">Asanka Nissanka</a>:</strong> well I don't have drivers for 64-bit at the moment but I'll give it a try, Anyways thank you for your interest</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"#10\" title=\"2013-05-17 00:51:55\">linux</a>:</strong> I am no longer positive the place you are getting your information, however great topic.
