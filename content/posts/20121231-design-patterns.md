# Design Patterns

A **pattern** is a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in software design. Design patterns have three main benefits as in the following.

  


  * Provide solid approaches to solving issues in software development using proven techniques. 
  * Usually reflects an out of box solution that can be adapted to suit our needs 
  * Helps with expressing larger solutions elegantly

  


Design Patterns can be categorized in to three main categories as in the following.

  


** Creational Patterns** \- _Based on the concept of creating an object_  


_  
_   


o   Abstract Factory

Creates an instance of several families of classes

o   Factory Method

Creates an instance of several derived classes

  


o   Prototype

A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

o   Singleton

A class of which only a single instance can exist 

  


  


 **Structural Patterns** \- _Based on the idea of building blocks of objects_

_  
_

o   Adapter

Match interfaces of different classes

o   Bridge

Separates an object’s interface from its implementation

o   Composite

A tree structure of simple and composite objects

  


  


**Behavioral Patterns** \- _Based on the way object play and work together_

_  
_   


o   Mediator

Defines simplified communication between classes

o   Observer

A way of notifying change to a number of classes

o   Template Method

Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
