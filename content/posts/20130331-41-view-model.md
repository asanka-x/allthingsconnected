# 4+1 View Model

Architecture of software-intensive system can be described using multiple, concurrent views. Based on this fact [Philipe Kruchten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Kruchten) developed a view model consists of 5 views, that a software architect can look at a system. But why is this called 4+1 view model rather 5 view model ? The obvious reason is unlike four views one view shows the systems functionality from the view point of the outside world.  


  


Following figure shows the 5 views, how they are related to each other and the diagrams used to explain each view.

**[cheap vps hosting](#17 "2013-06-12 20:40:42"):** Interesting blog post. A few things i would like to add is that computer system memory needs to be purchased when your computer cannot cope with anything you do along with it. One can set up two RAM boards with 1GB each, by way of example, but not one of 1GB and one having 2GB. One should make sure the car maker's documentation for own PC to make certain what type of memory is required.
