# Building large scale JavaScript web applications with BoilerplateJS..

JavaScript is now a highly demanded and popular language among developers. Because it is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented and cross-platform scripting language. Many libraries, frameworks and APIs have now been developed by many parties to address certain pain points. So the usage of JavaScript has now been extended from simple popups, alerts and data validations to large scale product suites.

  


Though there are enough JavaScript resources (libraries, frameworks and APIs), it is still a pain point to develop a large scale product suite where the advance programming concepts/standards like object orientation, modularity and design patterns have to be followed. So the requirement of a reference architecture was there.
