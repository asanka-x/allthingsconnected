# Scalability

![](http://gpssystems.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/business-software-scalability.jpg)

**  
****Scalability** is the ability of a system to increase the total throughput under an increased load when resources are added. And it can be measured using varoius dimentions. Such as  
  


            * Administrative scalability
            * Fuctional scalability
            * Geographic scalability
            * Load scalability

  


  


The **methods of adding more resources into a system** fall into two broad categories

  * _Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)_
    * Adding more nodes to a system

  * _Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)_
    * Adding more resources into a single node of a system
