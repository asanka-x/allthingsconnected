# Javascript Obfuscation

Obfuscation is a means of "obscuring" the real meaning and intent of your JavaScript code. Some sites use it as an obstacle to people who want to copy/borrow their code. Other sites use it as a means to hide the actual intention of the code.

Some forms of obfuscation:

  1. Automatically renaming variables to short meaningless names to make the code less readable and harder to understand.
  2. Removing all extra white space and line breaks so the code is one giant long line.
  3. Making parts of the code self-generating so that a first pass of the code runs to create the actual code that then runs to carry out the intended operation.
  4. Uses character codes and string manipulation combined with eval rather than normal JavaScript code to construct the actual code that would run.

Obfuscation is not by itself evil, but it can be used to try to hide an evil intent
