This is an implementation of [Pipes and Filter Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn568100.aspx) which is a commonly used [Cloud Design Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn568099.aspx). The most common approach to implement this pattern is via multiple queues as shown in the following figure.

###### Pipeline Using Multiple Queues ([Ref : MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn568100.aspx))

The prosed solution here uses a bit different approach than above and use a single queue instead of multiple queues as shown below.

###### Pipeline Using a Single Queue

To practically implement a solution like above the common approach would be to maintain a state for each queue message and assign a state for each workers(filters) to filter the messages accordingly before execution. However recently when I was trying out [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) I found [Firebase Queue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-queue) which is a queue implementation on top of the Firebase Realtime Database and it turned out that it comes with a out of the box solution for maintaining a state (their term is [specs](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-queue/blob/master/docs/guide.md#defining-specs-optional)) for queue messages as described above. So I worked on a PoC to evaluate this and in my personal opinion it's really cool. But this is not enough to make a dicission so I was looking at various benefits we can achieve here with the usage of [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/).

### Benefits

*   Using firebase realtime behaviour we can easily show the progress of the running tasks on a front-end
*   Since it's single queue it's less hazzle to implement and maintain
*   Uses push instead of polling to notify workers about new tasks
*   Implementation has been made super easy with their library
*   Nicely support to be run in a clustered environment distributing workload among nodes

### Use Cases

*   In scenarios where REST APIs facilitate time consuming processing heavy backÂ­end functions
*   In scenarios where triggered background tasks run for streaming data
